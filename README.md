## What Went Right
- We made a fully functional game 
- We met the requirements 
- We used Discord, Google Drive, and GitHub to transfer files and talk about what we are doing


## What Went Wrong
- Our timing was not what it should have been we didn't finish everything until the last minute 
- We didnâ€™t get our minigame done at all so we had to scrap it
